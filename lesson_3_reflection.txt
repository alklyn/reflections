When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you need to collaborate with other developers or share your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling manually allows you the chance to first inspect the changes in the remote before pulling.
