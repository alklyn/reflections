What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a new repository. 
You can't save your commits without a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where you put files before you commit them whereas the repository contains the files that have been commited & the working directory contains all the files.
It let's you see all the files about to be commited.
